# Intelligent Quantum Sensing with Quantum Neural Networks

## Introduction

A synergistic team consisting of researchers from LANL and George Mason University (GMU) has successfully integrated intelligence in the quantum sensor network by using Quantum Neural Network (QNN), such that the acquired data (e.g., seismic data) can be processed in-situ. 
The team took earthquake detection as a vehicle and built the end-to-end framework to evaluate the efficacy of intelligent sensing by encoding seismic data using amplititude, angnle and pulse, processing seismic data using QNN, and optimizing QNN architecture. One key outcome is a quantum neural network compression technique that can reduce quantum circuit length for multiple times while maintaining prediction accuracy, which was published at the 41st IEEE/ACM Conference on Computer-Aided Design. This work has been invited as tutorial talks at ACM/IEEE DAC'22, QuantumWeek'22, ESWEEK'22, and ICCAD'22.

This repo end-to-end gives examples of quantum learning on seismic data.
